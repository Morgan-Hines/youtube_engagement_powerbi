## Motivation
<details>
  <summary>
I was curious about the type of engagement YouTube videos received. And how those trends have changed over the years. My main criteria for engagement was likes, comments and views. Each video had a keyword attached that summed up the videos comments. A majority of these classifications came down to that keyword.
